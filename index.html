<h1>Spider-Man : Far From Home </h1>
<hr>
<img src="images/Spider-Man-FarFromHome-rating.jpg" width="239" height="326" />
<p>
	The title of the movie that we chose to review is the Spider-Man : Far From Home movie. The reason we chose the movie is that the movie had became a large attraction for young adolescents.
</p>
	
<h2>Publication, Director and Casts</h2>
<p>
	Spider-Man : Far From Home is a 2019 American Superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters, Spider-Man. Co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. Spider-Man : Far From Home was directed by Jon Watts. Jon Watts is also an American film director, producer, and screen writer. His credits include directing the Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero films such as the chosen movie, Spider-Man : Far From Home and the upcoming Spider-Man : No Way Home movie.

</p>
<p>
	The cast that took part in the movie is Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Marisa Tomei, Jake Gylenhall as well as others. 
</p>
	
<h2>Year of Publication</h2>
<p>
	The year of publication for the movie for TCL Chinese Theatre was 26th June, 2019 and for United States was on the 2nd July, 2019.
</p>	
	
<h2>Short summary of the movie</h2>
<p>
	Peter Parker, who is also Spider-Man, is a friendly neighbourhood superhero who decides to join his best friend Ned, MJ, and the rest of the gang on a European vacation. However, Peter’s plan to take a break from the superhero world was scrapped when he begrudgingly agrees to help Nick Fury uncover the mystery of several elemental creature attacks, creating havoc across the continent. 
</p>
	
<h2>Reasons why you like the movie</h2>
<p>
	The reason why we like the movie is because we admire the way Peter Parker tried to be just like his mentor, Tony Stark. 
</p>
<p>
	Another reason is how the production team also focuses on their use of CGI and effects. For example, allowing the Iron Man suit worn by Tony Stark to look realistic. 
</p>

<h2>Three (3) moral values learned from the movie</h2>
<p>
	- Family over everything
</p>
<p>
	In previous Avengers movies, it was shown that Happy was employed by Tony Stark and also as his best friend. The audience would meet Happy through Stark but would quickly realise that even through the countless faces of death, it would always be family over everything. When Peter finds himself lost in a strange place, it would be Happy who would come to Peter’s rescue. It would also be Happy to ensure that Peter’s friends were already taken care of during the invasion of the drones. 
</p>
<p>
	- Live your life
</p>
<p>
	In the movie, it was shown that Peter wanted to have a normal teenage life. Unfortunately, he couldn’t as he was also Spider-Man. His life was different than when we try to fit into someone else’s dreams or vision because in reality, his ‘call was greater’ and will save millions of lives. 
</p>
<p>
	- Chosen for a reason
</p>
<p>
	Peter Parker was specifically chosen by multi-billionaire Tony Stark because Stark deemed that Peter was destined for greatness before it was revealed to him, despite being at a young age. 
</p>
	
<h2>Recommendation for others</h2>
<p>
	Our opinion on the Spider-Man : Far From Home movie for everyone is that the movie is available for audiences of all ages although having a PG-13 rating for sci-fi action violence, some language and brief suggestive comments. The movie contains a variety of stunts starring Tom Holland who stars as Peter Parker. This Spider-Man movie also has various effect elements that can attract people to watch the movie. Our suggestion to everyone is that they should be able to watch Spider-Man : Far From Home with excitement and would be able to know more about the content of the story.
